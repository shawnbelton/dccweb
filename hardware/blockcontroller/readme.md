# Connecting a XCSource W5100 to an arduino

In order to keep the footprint of the
build small a XCSource W5100 Ethernet 
module or similar should be used for 
network connections. 

Pins
- GND – Ground from the Arduino
- VIN – +5V from Arduino
- NSS – Pin 10 from Arduino
- MO – Pin 11 from Arduino (MOSI)
- MI – Pin 12 from Arduino (MISO)
- SOK – Pin 13 from Arduino (SCK)
